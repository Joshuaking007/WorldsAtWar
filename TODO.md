# Todo list

* Set objects to invisible when 'deleted' - don't actually delete them.
* Positive integers on many fields in models.py
* For all uses of world_required decorator, pass the world directly from the decorator to the function
* Create a list at the start of the function and add fields to it rather than saving for every single transaction (e.g. movecomplete on war loss)
* Implement deferred loading for large pages e.g. news and comms
* Much heavier use of memcache throughout
* Fix use of 'if cond == None' and similar issues
* Rewrite alliance stats - inefficient
* Better use of Django forms for sanitisation etc.
